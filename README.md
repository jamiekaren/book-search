## Developer Details | Jamie K. Ferrugiaro

My name is Jamie Karen Ferrugiaro, and I'm currently a student in Rutger's web development bootcamp. I'm halfway through my program and most of the projects on this GitHub are still currently a part of that learning process.

### This App Development
It was challenge to work through this activity learning and creating the routing with the node server as well as the React server. I also enjoyed working with Reactstrap to use Bootstrap for design.
